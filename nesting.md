# Nesting

## Lesson Objectives

1. Describe nested routes
1. Create components for two sub sections

## Describe nested routes

Sometimes you want to have sub sections within a specific route (routes within routes).  We can accomplish this with nested routes.

## Create components for two sub sections

We're going to split `/about` into `/about/early-life` and `/about/career`.

Generate the two components:

```
ng generate component early-life
ng generate component career
```
